### Deployment

## AWS
TBD
Usual stack: ECS, ECR, CodeBuild, CloudFront, S3, Route53. All this delivered via Terraform.
Unusual stack #1: Beanstalk
Unusual stack #2: AppSync


## Bare metal
TBD
We use Traefik for deployment to raw linux servers. It is good reverse proxy / load balancer with HTTPS certificate generation.
