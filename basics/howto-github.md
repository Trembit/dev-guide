# How to work with Github

## Bootstrap
We put an extensive README.MD file with brief project description and how to start working guide. 
An newcomer should be able to launch local development environment easily with just few commands.

## Branching
We stick to standard development workflow inspired by Gitflow [Link 1](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow), [Link 2](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
Teams are responsible to follow best practices but able to slightly modify rules in reasonable cases.
